```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

# Setup

Before we go ahead and load in your very own data, let us
test your installation of ShinyLipids with the included
example dataset. This article assumes that you already
installed ShinyLipids with

```{r inst-sl, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jannikbuhr/ShinyLipids")
```

If this is the case, go ahead an run

```{r load-example, eval = FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata/exampleDatabase.db", package = "ShinyLipids")
databaseConnection <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path)
```

To specify the datbase connection to the example
database dump file. You are now ready to start exploring
ShinyLipids with

```{r run-ex-sl, eval = FALSE}
ShinyLipids::run_app(db = databaseConnection)
```
